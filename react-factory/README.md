# react-factory

## Problem Statement
In a recent requirement, we have to show differnt Website pages for different users. The layout, data, menu content, theme and everything would be coming from Server Response and we have to show the UI based on the response. Our base technology is ReactJS.

## Implementation
The problem is solved using a factory pattern in Javascript way. We are loading all the components when the application starts and the components are rendered as and when needed.

## Prerequisite
Basic knowledge of ReactJS Library is required to use this solution.

## Libraries used
Pure ReactJS

## How to approach
Start from index.js and follow along. The project is not very complex and does not have a lot of components to work with. src/data.js holds all the data for the application.

## Improvements
We are open to suggestions, if you have some better idea in your mind, please let us know.
